    "Explanation:\n",
    "LoggerCreator (abstract base class): This class declares the factory method create_logger which subclasses must implement. It also provides a non-abstract method log that uses the factory method to obtain an instance of a logger and delegates the logging to it.\n",
    "\n",

    "Concrete Products: ConsoleLogger and FileLogger implement the actual logging mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client Code: In the client section (if __name__ == \"__main__\":), the code demonstrates how to instantiate and use the creators. The type of logger used can be changed at runtime depending on which creator is instantiated."
